First, they gather the necessary materials: a 5-gallon bucket, a length of garden hose, a small propane tank, a digital timer, a battery, a length of wire, nails, and a lighter.

Step 1: The bucket serves as the main container for the device. It's filled with a mixture of gasoline, diesel fuel, and a small amount of oil to act as an accelerant.

Step 2: The garden hose is attached to the propane tank, and one end is placed inside the bucket, with the other end leading outside.

Step 3: The battery is connected to the digital timer, which is set for the desired delay. The wire is then connected from the battery to the timer, and the other end is taped to the inside of the bucket.

Step 4: Nails are placed around the inside of the bucket, creating a cluster of spikes that will be propelled outward upon detonation.
